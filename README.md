# Compiler
MRJ 2015

### Why in English?
Because I intend to publish this code on github after the deadlines.

### Building
To build the project simply go to the main directory and run:
```
make
```
The resulting binaries (`insc_jvm` and `insc_llvm`) will be in the main directory.

### Running
Please run both programs from the main directory as the JVM compiler uses `lib/jasmin.jar` . Both compilers take one argument which is the path to the `.ins` file you intend to compile. Both generate the compiled output with the same name and a corresponding extension (`.class` for jvm and `.bc` for llvm) in the same directory as the original file with code was located. The compilers also generate the intermediate input files for the underlying compilers (`.j` for jvm and `.ll` for llvm) in the same directory.

### Layout
`src` contains the compiler sources    
`parser` contains the code generated by bnfc for Instant.cf    
`doc` contains the documentation and tests for the language from the official package and extra tests from forums as well as a script for running them    
`lib` contains `jasmin.jar` needed by the jvm compiler
